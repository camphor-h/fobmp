In fact, this project is planned to be a part of another bigger picture analysis & display project. But, I still need time to achieve it.
If your computer system has set a High-DPI display mode. You may need find the window may get larger than it should be. I will fix this problem in future.

And, yet, You're welcome to share your effort to this "miserable and shabby" project if you want. I don't excel in C and computer. So, you could contact me to submit new code or even do-it-yourself. (～￣▽￣)～
